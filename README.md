# Basic_CV
This is my first attempt to computer vision. I have used very basic machine learning algorithm to identify alphabet present in the picture.
I took 28x28 images and then converted them into a 1-D array column wise and created a list of such arrays where each array in list is 1-D array of the image that i imported. And then applied Decision Tree Classifer to train my model.

I trained my model with 9 images of each alphabet and in testing it was able to identify the alphabets.

I did it using Python.
